I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where I study international relations in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.unlv.edu/people/kevin-navarrete-parra). 

My research focuses on international courts' role in the world economy, specifically as they relate to foreign direct investment and multinational corporations. My main interests are in: 

- how investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) arbitrations proceed from the (alleged) treaty violation to the concluding decision; 
- how the design and proliferation of investment agreements impact firms' behavior with regard to ISDS. 

In the course of conducting political science research, I've come to develop a strong passion for data science and programming. My first language is `R`, but I spend most of my time these days coding in `Python`--especially when I work on machine learning pipelines. No matter what I research, I'm always working hard to develop my programming and data science skills. Right now, I'm learning about: 

- using large language models for natural language inference tasks;
- training Word2Vec and Doc2Vec models for document classification; 
- employing computer vision models (like Detectron2) for image segmetation tasks.

I am originally from Mexicali, Baja California, but I've lived in Las Vegas, Nevada for most of my life. I got my B.A. from UNLV, where I studied political science. When I'm not working, I love to read the classics in philosophy and literature, and I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I also collect watches because I think they're cool.
