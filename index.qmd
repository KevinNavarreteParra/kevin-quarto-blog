Welcome to my website, where I write about things that interest me. I love programming in R and Python, and I enjoy learning about anything having to do with data science. And I like writing about programming, data science, my experience in academia, and watches when I get the chance. 

A few recent topics of interest include:

- Using large language models for natural language inference tasks;
- Building machine learning pipelines; 
- Working with Word2Vec models for document similarity.
