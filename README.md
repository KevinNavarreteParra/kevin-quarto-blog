# Kevin Navarrete-Parra - Academic Blog

A Quarto-based academic blog focusing on political science research, data science methods, and scholarly development.

## About This Site

This is the Quarto version of my academic blog, migrated from a Next.js/MDX setup to take advantage of Quarto's enhanced academic publishing features.

I built this website using Anthropic's Claude Code, which helped me migrate the website from the previous Tailwind version. **All substantive content, including blog posts, is my own.**
